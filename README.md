#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic creation and maintenance of reliable, efficient and scalable software. 
Its importance in the technology industry; it drives innovation, enables digital transformation, ensures security and facilitates economic growth.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The software crisis (late 1960s)  - led to the formalization of software engineering as a discipline, shifting from ad-hoc coding to structured methods
2. Structured and object-oriented programming (1970s-1990s) - introduced improved code organization and modularity, simplifying complex projects
4. Internet and agile development (1990s) - enabled rapid, iterative development and collaboration, adapting to the fast paced internet era

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Defining project goals, scope, timeline, and resources.
Feasibility Study: Assessing the project's technical, operational, and financial viability.
Design: Creating system architecture and detailed designs for components.
Implementation: Writing code based on design specifications.
Testing: Ensuring the software works correctly through various tests.
Deployment: Installing the system in the production environment.
Maintenance: Fixing bugs and updating the software as needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It's suitable for projects with clear requirements and no expected changes, e.g., a simple website with fixed requirements.
Agile: An iterative approach where development occurs in cycles (sprints), allowing flexibility for changes. It's ideal for projects where requirements might evolve, like app development with frequent update

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code, implements features, and fixes bugs based on requirements.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software, ensures it meets quality standards, and reports defects.
Project Manager: Oversees the project, manages resources, timelines, and communication between stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Help developers write code efficiently with features like auto-completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting. Example: Visual Studio Code.
VCS (Version Control Systems): Track and manage changes to code, making collaboration easier. Example: Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time Constraints: Tight deadlines can affect quality. Strategy: Prioritize tasks and manage time effectively.
Complex Requirements: Ambiguous or changing requirements. Strategy: Regular communication with stakeholders to clarify and refine requirements.
Debugging: Difficult bugs can be time-consuming. Strategy: Use proper debugging tools and strategies like unit testing and logging.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components for correctness. Ensures that each part works as expected.
Integration Testing: Ensures that different components work together as expected.
System Testing: Tests the complete system for overall functionality and performance.
Acceptance Testing: Verifies that the software meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the inputs (prompts) given to AI models to get the most accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. It involves crafting specific, clear, and well-structured queries to guide the AI toward producing the desired result.

Importance:
Accuracy: A well-designed prompt helps AI understand the context and requirements more clearly, leading to more accurate responses.
Efficiency: By being specific in the prompt, you avoid vague or irrelevant responses, saving time and effort.
User Experience: Clear prompts lead to better communication with AI, improving how effectively users can interact with the model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt: "Can you provide a comparison between electric cars and gasoline cars, focusing on their environmental impact and fuel efficiency?"

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Specificity: It narrows down the topic (electric vs. gasoline cars) rather than asking a broad question about all cars.
Clarity: It clearly defines the aspects to focus on (environmental impact and fuel efficiency).
Conciseness: It avoids unnecessary details while still being clear about what the user wants to know.
The improved prompt helps guide the AI to give a more focused and relevant response, saving time and avoiding confusion.
